## Introduction
The new and improved (WordPress free) CompSoc website, built on Bootstrap &amp; react. With additional features planned, the current website allows students to find out about our committee, the society and get in touch with us. Additionally, they can view up to date society events which are pulled directly from the NUI Galway Societies website at [socs.nuigalway.ie](https://socs.nuigalway.ie/societies.php?id=MzA=).

## Developer Notes
