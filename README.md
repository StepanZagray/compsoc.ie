## Introduction

The new and improved (WordPress free) CompSoc website, built on Tanstack router &amp; react. With additional features planned, the current website allows students to find out about our committee, the society and get in touch with us. Additionally, they can view up to date society events which are pulled directly from the University of Galway Societies website at [socs.universityofgalway.ie](https://socs.universityofgalway.ie/societies/).
